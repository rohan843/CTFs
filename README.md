# CTFs

This repository will contain the solutions to any CTF (capture-the-flag) type problems attempted or solved.

Each CTF will have its own folder with any relevant information.

Those CTFs that have been solved will contain a `README.md` file explaining the process and providing a link to the source of the CTF website.

The READMEs will NOT contain the actual flag, only the way to extract it.

Refer to [this](./strategies.md) document for common strategies.
