# Operation Oni

This CTF is available [here](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/284?category=4&page=1&solved=1).

It asks us to run a remote instance, and provides us a disk image and an `ssh` command to access that machine.

I'll explore the disk image in autopsy.

Judging from the ssh command, we are looking for a key file in the disk.
